# Week 1 Homework - Code Refactor

For this week's homework assignment we were tasked with refactoring some existing code.
I renamed div tags into more semantic elements such as header, section, and aside. I added alt text to all images and logos, as well as changing the photo from a div with a background to a figure element with nested image.
